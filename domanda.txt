Hello everyone. It's been 2 weeks now but statistics is not my main field. 

I'm trying to draw a normal distribution curve in C# based on the galton machine experiment. The objective is to represent the number of times a ball falls in the corresponding hole using the density function through the simulation software I'm designing. What I do is:

1. Get the dataset
2. Get the mean 
3. Get the variance
4. Get the standard deviation
5. Decide a range for the X, min and max (in my case, from -5 to +5)
6. Set the X for the function from min to max (using a step of 1, so if the range is from -5 to +5, there will 10 x's)
7. Get the Y using the density function
8. Insert my X and Y values into an array of points and plot them
